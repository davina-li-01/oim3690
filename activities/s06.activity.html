<h1>Coding an HTML File Activity – S06 – 2/5/26</h1>

    <h2>Activity: Coding an HTML File</h2>
    <p>In this activity, I am messing around with coding an HTML file. I am just going to type random paragraphs in the beginning and if I think of anything I want to try and code I will do it in the following paragraphs</p>

    <h2>My Personal Website</h2>
    <p>My <a href="https://davina-li-01.github.io/"
    target="_blank">Personal Website</a> serves to display who I am, what I do, my experiences, and projects that I will be working on this class. Currently the home page is not the one I am working on because that one is still incorrect, but it will be updated soon.</p>

    <h2>Current Progress</h2>
    <p>Here is the other index page I'm working on that will replace the one I currently have. I wanted to make it more personalized but wanted to keep the current one since it is a bit more complete.</p>
