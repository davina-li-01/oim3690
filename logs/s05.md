- Changes the title of the document to "Hello world!"

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)


## Challenges I faced
Figuring out how to use and read the terminal in that portion of class because I'm using a mac and it wasn't the same compared to what was being shown. Also just understanding why we were looking at them since I was just trying to figure out where everything was during class.

## AI usage (if any)
