## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)
I'm proud that I kept up in class today and was able to figure out why the code I was pushing wasn't not showing up. 

## Challenges I faced
There was an issue where I was not writing summaries before hitting "Commit file to main" which was the reason why my code wasn't showing up. I was also growing impatient when the code was still being deployed and thought the code didn't work tried pushing multiple versions and it ended up just taking a really time to deploy. 

## AI usage (if any)
I want to say: About Me: I'm Davina, a Junior interested in Product Management and eager to understand how products work. Let's collaborate! Please make my text html

Output:

<section>
  <h2>About Me</h2>
  <p>

## Questions for next time
