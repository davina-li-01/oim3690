# Learning Log – Session 7 – 2/10 – Web

## What I learned today

- Most HTML have open and end tags
- <ul> = unordered list
- <li> = list item

- if no https://www. before babson.edu, it treats babson.edu as a file NOT a WEBSITE.
- You can have multiple <h1> tags but it's not recommended
    - Why? B/c its supposed to be the biggest title in the website
- Need to add alt text to an image --> For blind people, or for when the link is broken still shows text as a placehoolder
- <meta charset="UTF-8"> = what language it's written in
- <strong> - similar to bold just better for blind people using the read function
- <em> - 'Emphasis' similar to italics but better for blind people using the read function
- <div> - division | having many elements within one box
- <span> ??
- semantic = meaningful
    - Non-semantic [Usually what AI generates]
    - Why use semantic HTML: Accesibilty , for SEO
- Dev Tools on Web --> Lighthouse --> Analyze how good your page is
- How to modify code --> Select Code --> Command + Shift + I --> Will pull up Copilot VS helper

- New tags I learned?
- <iframe> --> To embed videos, <mark> --> To highlight text

- What Copilot prompts worked well?
- Create navigation menu with links
