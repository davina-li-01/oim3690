1. Product Overview

Product Name: Delta Sigma Pi – Gamma Upsilon Chapter Website
Owner: Davina Li
Date: 2/13/26
Version: 1.0

1.1 Summary

The Delta Sigma Pi Gamma Upsilon Chapter website is the official digital hub for the chapter at Babson College. The website will serve prospective members, current brothers, alumni, and corporate partners by providing information about recruitment, leadership, events, and chapter values.

The goal is to create a professional, modern, and easy-to-navigate website that reflects the prestige of both Delta Sigma Pi and the Gamma Upsilon Chapter.

2. Background / Context

The Gamma Upsilon Chapter currently lacks a centralized, professional web presence that:

Clearly explains recruitment

Showcases leadership and professionalism

Highlights events and achievements

Serves as a resource for alumni and sponsors

As a professional fraternity at Babson, a strong digital presence is critical for:

Recruitment competitiveness

Brand positioning

Alumni engagement

Corporate credibility

3. Problem Statement

Prospective members and external stakeholders struggle to find reliable, organized information about the Gamma Upsilon Chapter because there is no dedicated, structured website.

This results in:

Confusion during recruitment

Missed engagement opportunities

Reduced brand credibility

Lower alumni and corporate connection potential

If not addressed, the chapter risks appearing less professional compared to peer organizations.
