# Learning Log – Session 7 – 2/10 – Web

## What I learned today

2/19/26:

REVIEW:
Basic CSS Syntax:

selector{
    property: value;
    property: value;
}

What are selectors?
-> Tells us what elements to apply the 'rules' outlined to
--> Kinda like "Who {Get's styled like this}
Examples:

p {
  color: blue;
}

Here, p is the selector. It selects all <p> elements and makes their text blue.

Selector	Targets	Example
Element	All elements of type	p { }
Class	Elements with class	.intro { }
ID	Element with ID	#header { }
Universal	All elements	* { }

What is class?
--> Label you give to one or more elements so you can style them together (Like a tag)
--> “Style all elements with this sticker the same way.”
--> HTML: <div class="card">Hello</div>
          <p class="card">Hi</p>
--> CSS: Select a class using a '.'
.card {
  background-color: lightgray;
  padding: 20px;
}

What is ID?
--> Unique name given to one specific HTML element so you can target it directly. 
--> Kinda like a student ID number — only one person should have it.
--> HTML: <div id="header">Welcome</div>
--> CSS: Select an ID using "#"
#header {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}

Combining Selectors:
p.intro { } → Selects paragraphs that have the class "intro".

div#sidebar { } → Selects the div that has the ID "sidebar".

.btn.primary { } → Selects elements that have both "btn" AND "primary" classes.

nav a { } → Selects all links inside a nav (any level inside).

ul > li { } → Selects list items that are directly inside a ul (not deeper nested ones).

Selector Specificity
From lowest to highest priority:

Element selectors: p, div, h1
Class selectors: .intro, .btn
ID selectors: #header, #main
Inline styles: style="..."

When in doubt, use classes

Common Properties:

- Colors:
/* Named colors */
color: red;
background-color: lightblue;

/* Hex colors */
color: #ff0000;
background-color: #3498db;

/* RGB / RGBA */
color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* 50% transparent */

Typography
font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
font-size: 16px;
font-weight: bold;      /* or 400, 700, etc. */
font-style: italic;
text-align: center;     /* left, right, justify */
text-decoration: underline;
line-height: 1.5;

- Fonts:
If you want to use embedded code for a specific font online:
<link href = "INSERT LINK FROM GOOGLE'S FONT WEBSITE at fonts.google.com>

Then you can use the font and indicate it like this:

    body {
        font-family: 'Roboto',sans-serif;
    }

<!-- In <head> -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap"
      rel="stylesheet">
body {
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}

Each element is in a box:
1. Content: actual content
2. Paddng: space inside the border
3. Border: the edige
4. Margin: space outside of the border

DSP WEBSITE:
Mileston 0: Created the actual Proposal.md based on the inital proposal.md I wrote to match what you had outlined to do.
Mileston 1: Utilized AI by simply copy and pasting what I had gathered in my interviews into the Copilot Agent within VS code to generate the base of what the website would look like.
Milestone 2: Currently working on uploading all relevant information into the website (i.e. gathering headshots, names, class years, concentrations, recognitions for the chapter)

## Challenges I faced

I think the biggest challenge I'm facing right now is finding the time to consistently mess around with AI and iterate on my personal website which I know I have not done a lot of work on and plan on working on this weekend (2/21). Right now, I am juggling a new role at my company (Product Operations Associate) and it's been quite overwhelming because I am learning things in this class that are completely new and also needing to figure out everything in my current role which I also know remotely nothing about. But I am doing my best to do the activities in class, I just haven't had the time to fully understand what is going on in the class since we are learning a lot of things very quickly, which is probably why I think I did poorly in the quiz (an assumption).

I'm working on managing my workload better, but I've definitely been feeling greatly overwhelmed with the amount of learning I'm doing with barely any time to process the things I am learning.

## AI usage (if any)

I've been using AI to help me build the DSP website mini project, but I am taking notes on things I don't know and am learning about the elements in incremental bits.
