# Learning Log – Session 7 – 2/10 – Web

## What I learned today

2/19/26:

REVIEW:
Basic CSS Syntax:

selector{
    property: value;
    property: value;
}

What are selectors?
-> Tells us what elements to apply the 'rules' outlined to
--> Kinda like "Who {Get's styled like this}
Examples:

p {
  color: blue;
}

Here, p is the selector. It selects all <p> elements and makes their text blue.

Selector	Targets	Example
Element	All elements of type	p { }
Class	Elements with class	.intro { }
ID	Element with ID	#header { }
Universal	All elements	* { }

What is class?
--> Label you give to one or more elements so you can style them together (Like a tag)
--> “Style all elements with this sticker the same way.”
--> HTML: <div class="card">Hello</div>
          <p class="card">Hi</p>
--> CSS: Select a class using a '.'
.card {
  background-color: lightgray;
  padding: 20px;
}

What is ID?
--> Unique name given to one specific HTML element so you can target it directly. 
--> Kinda like a student ID number — only one person should have it.
--> HTML: <div id="header">Welcome</div>
--> CSS: Select an ID using "#"
#header {
  background-color: black;
  color: white;
}

Combining Selectors:
p.intro { } → Selects paragraphs that have the class "intro".

div#sidebar { } → Selects the div that has the ID "sidebar".

.btn.primary { } → Selects elements that have both "btn" AND "primary" classes.

nav a { } → Selects all links inside a nav (any level inside).

ul > li { } → Selects list items that are directly inside a ul (not deeper nested ones).

Selector Specificity
From lowest to highest priority:

Element selectors: p, div, h1
Class selectors: .intro, .btn
ID selectors: #header, #main
Inline styles: style="..."

When in doubt, use classes

Common Properties:

- Colors:
/* Named colors */
color: red;
background-color: lightblue;

/* Hex colors */
color: #ff0000;
background-color: #3498db;

/* RGB / RGBA */
color: rgb(255, 0, 0);
background-color: rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.5); /* 50% transparent */

Typography
font-family: Arial, sans-serif;
font-size: 16px;
font-weight: bold;      /* or 400, 700, etc. */
font-style: italic;
text-align: center;     /* left, right, justify */
text-decoration: underline;
line-height: 1.5;

- Fonts:
If you want to use embedded code for a specific font online:
<link href = "INSERT LINK FROM GOOGLE'S FONT WEBSITE at fonts.google.com>

Then you can use the font and indicate it like this:

    body {
        font-family: 'Roboto',sans-serif;
    }

<!-- In <head> -->
<link href="https://fonts.googleapis.com/css2?family=Roboto&display=swap"
      rel="stylesheet">
body {
  font-family: 'Roboto', sans-serif;
}

Each element is in a box:
1. Content: actual content
2. Paddng: space inside the border
3. Border: the edige
4. Margin: space outside of the border

## DSP WEBSITE:

Milestone 0: Created the actual Proposal.md based on the inital proposal.md I wrote to match what you had outlined to do.

Milestone 1: Utilized AI by simply copy and pasting what I had gathered in my interviews into the Copilot Agent within VS code to generate the base of what the website would look like.

Milestone 2: Currently working on uploading all relevant information into the website (i.e. gathering headshots, names, class years, concentrations, recognitions for the chapter)

# Things I've learned about AI:

1. If you ask it to separate everything into appropriate files, it can do that automatically for you and also add semantic tags to your HTML files when you ask it to do so.

2. It kinda labels each section in the CSS file to show you what selectors are in a certain section of the file.

# Things I Learned from building DSP Website/ Reviewed

HTML FILES:
    <a class="brand" href="index.html" aria-label="Delta Sigma Pi Gamma Upsilon Home"> 
    class: What style to apply | href: By clicking on this where does it go | aria: What is the link about
      <span class="brand-mark">ΔΣΠ</span>
      What style to apply | Text within the link
      <span class="brand-text">Gamma Upsilon</span>
      What style to apply | Text within the link      
    </a>
It’s a clickable logo/brand section that takes you to the homepage and displays “ΔΣΠ Gamma Upsilon.”

<span> = A way to style or target a small part of text without breaking the layout.

<span> is inline (it stays in the same line of text).
It’s different from <div>, which is block-level (starts on a new line).

aria-label: A hidden description that helps screen readers understand an element (ACCESSIBILITY --> similar to alt for images)
<main>
  <section class="hero">
    <h1>Delta Sigma Pi</h1>
    <p>Gamma Upsilon Chapter • Babson College</p>
    <a href="recruitment.html" class="cta-btn">Explore Recruitment</a>
  </section>

<section class="section reveal" id="pillars">
    <div class="content-container">
      <h2>Our Pillars</h2>
      <div class="card-grid pillars-grid">
        <a class="card pillar-link-card" href="professionalism.html" aria-label="Learn more about Professionalism">
          <h3>Professionalism</h3>
          <p>We develop principled business leaders through skill-building and real-world preparation.</p>
        </a>

Internal thought process (w/ no AI explanation): 

Section 1:
1. Within the main content of the page, there will be multiple sections.
2. Within the first section, the style of the section will be linked to the class in the CSS file named 'hero'
3. The header of the section will be 'Delta Sigma Pi'
4. The paragraph will say 'Gamma Upsilon Chapter • Babson College'
5. Below that there will be a CTA button that links to the recruitment page, with the style of that button being linked to the class in the CSS file named 'cta-btn' and tied to the text within the button stating 'Explore Recruitment'

Section 2:
1. Within the second section, the style of the section will be tied to the class in the CSS file named 'section reveal' but creating a unique stylistic choice for this section outlined as 'pillars'
2. Within the section, there will be different divisons (also seen as widgets) that will have the style linked in the CSS file called 'card-grid pillars-grid'
3. The entire widget will then be linked to the professionalism page with a hidden description for accessibility that says 'Learn more about professionalism' with it's style for clicking the widget linked to the class in the CSS file indicated by 'card pillar-link-card"
4. In the widget, the header would be 'Professionalism'
5. The pargraphj would be 'We develop principled business leaders through skill-building and real-world preparation.'

<ul class="industry-list">
      <li>Finance</li>
      <li>Consulting</li>
      <li>Marketing</li>
      <li>Business Development / Entrepreneurship</li>
    </ul>

Internal thought process (w/ no AI explanation):

1. <ul class> A bullet-point list that has a styling label linked to the class in the CSS file called 'industry-list'
2. <li> Item within that list
3. Within this list, there will be four items (Finance, Consulting, Marketing, Business Development/Entrepreneurship)

<article class="stat-bubble">

Internal thought process (w/ no AI explanation):
1. <article> complete content box
2. The article will have a style with class linked in the CSS file called 'stat-bubble'

| If it’s a…             | It looks like…      |Why                                         |
| ---------------------- | ------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| **HTML tag (element)** | `h1`, `p`, `footer` | You’re selecting the element directly       |
| **Class**              | `.card`             | The `.` means “class”                       |
| **ID**                 | `#header`           | The `#` means “ID”                          |
| **Root pseudo-class**  | `:root`             | The `:` means it’s a special state/selector |


## Challenges I faced

I think the biggest challenge I'm facing right now is finding the time to consistently mess around with AI and iterate on my personal website which I know I have not done a lot of work on and plan on working on this weekend (2/21). Right now, I am juggling a new role at my company (Product Operations Associate) and it's been quite overwhelming because I am learning things in this class that are completely new and also needing to figure out everything in my current role which I also know remotely nothing about. But I am doing my best to do the activities in class, I just haven't had the time to fully understand what is going on in the class since we are learning a lot of things very quickly, which is probably why I think I did poorly in the quiz (an assumption).

I'm working on managing my workload better, but I've definitely been feeling greatly overwhelmed with the amount of learning I'm doing with barely any time to process the things I am learning.

## AI usage (if any)
I use AI to help me understand parts of the code I don't understand that AI had generated.

I've been using AI to help me build the DSP website mini project, but I am taking notes on things I don't know and am learning about the elements in incremental bits.
