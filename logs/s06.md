# Learning Log – Session 5 – 2/3 – Web

## What I learned today

- If link does not work --> Inspect > Elements to find issue
- <a href ="www/babon.edu"> -> GET AN ERROR MESSAGE
- missing https://

- <nav> means belongs to navigation bar
- justify content --> space-between = "title on the far left of nav bar, buttons on the far right of the nav bar"
- justify content --> centered = "title and buttons are in the center of the navigtion bar"

- prettier -> formatting code in a pretty way
- shift + command + p "Format Document"
- <a href="#about">About</a>
    - In super simple terms:
    - <a> = “make this clickable”
    - href="#about" = “when clicked, jump to the place called about on this same page”
    About = the text the user sees and clicks
- 'a' = anchor
- 'div' = division
- html is not a programming language

- </title> changes the title of the tab
- <h1> - <h6> different heading levels
- <p> paragraphs
- <a> links
- <img> images
- <div> Generic container

- html:5 TAB > Creates the industry standard way to start a file

## Challenges I faced
Figuring out how to use and read the terminal in that portion of class because I'm using a mac and it wasn't the same compared to what was being shown. Also just understanding why we were looking at them since I was just trying to figure out where everything was during class.

## AI usage (if any)
