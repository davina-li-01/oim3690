# Learning Log – Session 6 – 2/5 – Web

## What I learned today

- If link does not work --> Inspect > Elements to find issue
- <a href ="www/babon.edu"> -> GET AN ERROR MESSAGE
- missing https://

- <nav> means belongs to navigation bar
- justify content --> space-between = "title on the far left of nav bar, buttons on the far right of the nav bar"
- justify content --> centered = "title and buttons are in the center of the navigtion bar"

- prettier -> formatting code in a pretty way
- shift + command + p "Format Document"
- <a href="#about">About</a>
    - In super simple terms:
    - <a> = “make this clickable”
    - href="#about" = “when clicked, jump to the place called about on this same page”
    About = the text the user sees and clicks
- 'a' = anchor
- 'div' = division
- html is not a programming language

- </title> changes the title of the tab
- <h1> - <h6> different heading levels
- <p> paragraphs
- <a> links
- <img> images
- <div> Generic container

- html:5 TAB > Creates the industry standard way to start a file

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)

## Challenges I faced
Figuring out how to use and read the terminal in that portion of class because I'm using a mac and it wasn't the same compared to what was being shown. Also just understanding why we were looking at them since I was just trying to figure out where everything was during class.

I struggled to figure out how to prompt AI correctly to make my website not just hug the left side of the screen. Once I was able to correct the website layout after 'torturing' my AI, I asked it to tell me what prompt to say if this issue happened again and here's what it said:

I need you to fix layout and responsiveness only — not redesign anything.

Problem:
The layout is hugging the left side / feels constrained / doesn’t fill the viewport properly on desktop.

What I want:

A fully responsive, edge-to-edge layout that fills the browser width on desktop

Content should start closer to the left like a modern dashboard, not centered in a narrow column

Layout should be mobile-first, then intelligently expand into a desktop grid as screen width increases

Widgets should resize and reflow fluidly using responsive units (%, fr, minmax, clamp)

Especially ensure the “Hi I’m Davina” and “What I Do” widgets adapt smoothly from desktop → tablet → mobile

What you must NOT change:

Do NOT change colors, typography, spacing scale, copy, or visual theme

Do NOT redesign widgets or alter their structure

Do NOT center everything or introduce a fixed max-width container unless absolutely necessary

Do NOT remove or replace existing animations

Special constraint:

Preserve the existing “now playing” animation exactly as implemented

Reuse animation logic already present — do not invent a new one

Output requirements:

Update CSS layout rules only (Grid/Flex/media queries)

Keep everything else exactly the same

Explain changes briefly, then provide the full updated CSS

Goal:
The site should feel like a responsive personal dashboard, not a centered card layout stretched across screen sizes.

## AI usage (if any)

The entire website.

## Questions for next time
I missed how to show a code excerpt in an html file, how do you do that? I remember it looked something like "''' html" but I'm not sure if that's correct.
