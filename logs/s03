## 10 Things I Don't Understand About the HTML Output Below

1. Why do we start with !DOCTYPE at the top?
2. Why are there two .widget sections? It says widget container and frosted glass cards but why are they separated?
3. What do all of the different brakets mean? (i.e [] {} ())
4. What does justify-content do?
4. What does display mean?
5. If I outline the paramaters/design/fonts etc. I want for this page, does that automatically carry over to other pages?
6. What does div class="widgets" mean?
7. When creating a gradient, is rgba the color wheel?
8. Why do we add html lang="en" before we describe the design elements of the interface?
9. Does /* have the same function as # in HTML?
10.  </div> </body> </html> Why are these at the end of the script?


What I Created:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
  <meta charset="UTF-8" />
  <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
