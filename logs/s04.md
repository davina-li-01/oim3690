# Learning Log – Session 4 – 1/29 – Setting Up GitHub/VS Code

## What I learned today

<!DOCTYPE html>
→ Most websites start with this code at the top
→ What is it: Defines the entire document ““Hey, this file is written in HTML5 — render it using modern standards.”

<head> = brain / instructions
→This is the behind-the-scenes part of the page. 
→ Stuff here doesn’t show up visually on the page.

<body> = face / outfit / vibes
→ This is the actual visible content of the page — what users see.

<meta>
→ Bed of data
→ Tags are tiny info cards about your page — they live inside <head> and give the browser (and Google, phones, social apps, etc.) instructions. They don’t show on the page, but they matter a lot.

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)


## Challenges I faced
The challenge I faced today was definitely giving AI the correct prompt to bring my vision to life for my personal website. I was not very happy with the layout and how the widgets looked, and it took a bit of trial and error to get the correct prompt to fix it.

## AI usage (if any)
The entire website.

## Questions for next time
